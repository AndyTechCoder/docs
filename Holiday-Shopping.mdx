## Returns

During the holiday season, we believe you should focus on family, and not on keeping track of all deliveries and returns. Enjoy the break, we've got the returns covered.

<Info>
  Returns for all returnable items have been extended to the 26th of February 2026, or 75 days after the order, whichever is later.
</Info>

## Delivery

During the holiday season, orders become warm, shining gifts that bring us closer. To ensure they get delivered on time, make sure you order on time.

<Tip>
  Order by the 20th of December 2025 to get your order in time for the holidays.
